# nepal-it-pool
A simple way to list tech workforce in Nepal.

Simple api made on GO and ElasticSearch with json data.

Goto https://itpool.network/ for listings     

## Filters

All filters are query string param i.e https://itpool.network/?name=ujwal&skills=php,java

## Why do we need this
* Since tech in nepal is so small and most techies are here in kathmandu we could get to know skills nearby so well
* Still there are not enough skilled resource available for tech so this could be one stop for all job seeker 

So here some search filters 

* name (e.g name=ujwal)
* designation (e.g designation=Software Engineer) 
* actively_job_searching (e.g actively_job_searching=false)
* max_exp (e.g max_exp=5)
* min_exp (e.g min_exp=2)
* skills (e.g skills=java,php)
* previous_companies (e.g skills=ICN, Responsive Pixel, Pagevamp / Outside)
* is_intern (e.g is_intern=false)
* address (e.g address=Kathmandu,Nepal)
* state (e.g state=3)

For Pagination 
* limit (currently 10 is the default limit)
* offset

For sorting use
* sort=key only `"experience", "name", "current_company","is_intern","actively_job_searching"` keys are available
* sort_type=asc or desc , by default asc is used
